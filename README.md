## Ecommerce Text Classification
## Problem Statement

Product categorization also referred to as product classification, is a field of study within natural language processing (NLP). It is also one of the biggest challenges for e-commerce companies. With the advancement of AI technology, researchers have been applying machine learning to product categorization problems.

Product categorization is the placement and organization of products into their respective categories. In that sense, it sounds simple: choose the correct department for a product. However, this process is complicated by the sheer volume of products on many e-commerce platforms. Furthermore, many products could belong to multiple categories.
There are many reasons why product categorization is important for e-commerce and marketing. Through the accurate classification of your products, you can increase conversion rates, strengthen your search engine, and improve your siteâ€™s Google ranking.

A well-built product taxonomy allows customers to find what they are looking for quickly and easily. Making your site easy to navigate is one of the most important elements of your UX and will lead to higher conversion rates.

Correctly categorizing products allows your search engine to fetch products quicker. As a result, you create a quicker and more accurate search engine. Once you have a strong product taxonomy in place, this will allow you to create the relevant landing pages for your products. In turn, Google and other search engines will be able to index your site and your products more easily. In the end, this allows your products to rank higher on search engines, increasing the chance that customers find your site.

To help merchants choose the correct category, Amazon and other e-commerce companies have automated product categorization tools available. After simply inputting the title or a few words about the product, the system can automatically choose the correct category for you.
